### **v0.0.1**

**Release:** First Public Release 🎉
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Maintainer:** Zyra Engineering LLC (@zyra-engineering-ltda)

#### 🚀 Overview

WatchDoggo is an open-source, lightweight service-status monitor built with **Python + Flask**.
It pings your APIs, CRMs, and infrastructure endpoints and presents a clear, friendly uptime dashboard — so you know when something’s barking before it breaks 🐾.

#### ✨ Key Features

* **Service Health Checks** – Ping multiple APIs/endpoints from one JSON config (`config/services.json`).
* **Live Status Dashboard** – Responsive web UI for quick visibility.
* **Custom Logging** – Centralized per-service logs (`service_monitor.log`).
* **Configurable Intervals** – Different polling schedules per service.
* **JSON Configuration** – Simple, human-readable settings.
* **Lightweight Flask Backend** – Runs anywhere: macOS, Linux, Docker.
* **Extensible Adapters** – Built-in `ping`, `custom_html`, and `json` parsers.

#### ⚙️ Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyra-engineering-ltda/watch-doggo.git
cd watch-doggo
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

`config/services.json` example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Active Prospect",
    "url": "https://status.activeprospect.com/",
    "adapter": "custom_html",
    "service_selector": ".component-inner-container"
  }
]
```
